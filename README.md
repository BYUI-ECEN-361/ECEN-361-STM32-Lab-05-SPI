# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-05-SPI
## BYU-I  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
## Overview / Purpose
This lab introduces three different digital serial communication protocols:  SPI, I2C, and USART while showing the student how to see these with a Logic Analyzer.

All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the WORD document in your cloned repo: 

>Documentation/Assignment.md

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github.   The commit will upload this document as well and serves as the lab submission.

Note that there will be almost no modification of the code in this lab.  Most of the work will be in learning to work with the **Logic Analyzer** and understanding the code that initiates the independent hardward communication blocks in the **STM32F476RG**.

The final part of the assignment is to paste the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
